I personally use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

## Steps:
- git clone https://github.com/jackbrewer7/react-aws-template.git
- Open project in IntelliJ
- Open as Maven project
- Open the terminal in IntelliJ

Some dependencies may have to be installed
- Java
- Node

- Gulp
-- npm install --global gulp-cli (inside root of directory)

Then run:
- mvn clean install
